# PeerToPeer CDN
This project provides a peer to peer CDN to deliver content directly between browsers in a collaborative manner. It uses Webrtc for the content delivery and service worker to intercept requests. This project aims to be a plugin solution. So the changes required to add the peer to peer CDN should keept as small as possible. Currently only the whitelist of shareable ressources needs to be changed to adapt the cdn to a new project.

## Browser Support
The Project is currently tested and developed for Chrome 68 only.
